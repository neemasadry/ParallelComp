# ParallelComp

## Assignments from Parallel Computing I: Programming (Fall 2022) course

These are the four assignments I worked on for my Parallel Computing during my time as a graduate student working towards my MS in Computer Science degree. The goals of the assingment were to:
  1) Adding two 256x256 matrices using Pthreads
  2) Adding two 2048x2048 matrices using MPI on 8 processors
  3) Implementing a *parallelized* odd-even algorithm and comparing its performance against a typical *sequential* implementation
  <!-- 3) Multiplying two square matrices using OpenMP
      - 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 thread sizes running on university's grid computing service -->
  

I learned and worked with the following languages and tools in-depth: 
  - `C` & `C++`
  - `Pthreads`
  - `OpenMP`
  - `MPI`
  - [Grid computing](https://tech.wayne.edu/hpc-tutorials) (i..e, high-performance computing (HPC))
  - Other (shell scripting, Git, GitHub, )

Furthermore, `Bash` scripting and `Makefile`s were used to streamline the program's execution and compilation processes, respectively.

Basic instructions can be found in `txt` files titled `README`. Results of the program can be found in respective `txt` and/or `pdf` files.

*While a few minor complications were encountered, the majority of the assignment requirements were successfully achieved.*
